The paper provides an overview of risk-adjusted charts, with examples based on two data sets: the first consisting of outcomes following cardiac surgery and patient factors contributing to the Parsonnet score; the second being age–sex-adjusted death-rates per year under a single general practitioner. Charts presented include the cumulative sum (CUSUM), resetting sequential probability ratio test, the sets method and Shewhart chart. Comparisons between the charts are made. Estimation of the process parameter and two-sided charts are also discussed. The CUSUM is found to be the least efficient, under the average run length (ARL) criterion, of the resetting sequential probability ratio test class of charts, but the ARL criterion is thought not to be sensible for comparisons within that class. An empirical comparison of the sets method and CUSUM, for binary data, shows that the sets method is more efficient when the in-control ARL is small and more efficient for a slightly larger range of in-control ARLs when the change in parameter being tested for is larger. The Shewart p-chart is found to be less efficient than the CUSUM even when the change in parameter being tested for is large.},

Two examples are used to demonstrate the practical issues of quality control in the medical setting, the first a running example and the second a fully worked example at the end of the paper. The first example relates to 30-day mortality for patients of a single cardiac surgeon over the period 1994-1998, the second to patient deaths in the practice of a single GP, Harold Shipman. The charts' performances relative to each other are shown to be sensitive to the definition of the 'out of control' state of the process being monitored.

A number of options for handling this phenomenon are investigated, ranging from improved risk stratification to fitting a statistical model that robustly estimates the degree of over-dispersion. Design: Retrospective analysis of publicly available data on survival following coronary artery bypass grafts, emergency readmission rates, and teenage pregnancies. Setting: NHS trusts in England. Results: Funnel plots clearly show the influence of the method chosen for dealing with over-dispersion on the “banding” a trust receives. Both multiplicative and additive approaches are feasible and give intuitively reasonable results, but the additive random effects formulation appears to have a stronger conceptual foundation. Conclusion: A random effects model may offer a reasonable solution. This method has now been adopted by the UK Healthcare Commission in their derivation of star ratings.},

A common approach to data standardization based on (possibly overdispersed) Z-scores is proposed, although specific tools are used for assessing performance against a target, combining indicators when screening for inspection, and continuous monitoring using risk-adjusted sequential testing procedures.

We describe a new CUSUM procedure that adjusts for each patient's pre-operative risk of surgical failure through the use of a likelihood-based scoring method.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe most commonly used models for count regression, Poisson and negative binomial, were presented in Chapter 3. In this chapter we introduce richer models for count regression using cross-section data. For some of these models the conditional mean retains the exponential functional form. Then the Poisson QMLE and NB2 ML estimators remain consistent, although they may be inefficient and may not be suitable for predicting probabilities, rather than the conditional mean. For many of these models, however, the Poisson and NB2 estimators are inconsistent. Then alternative methods are used, ones that generally rely heavily on parametric assumptions.One reason for the failure of the Poisson regression is that the Poisson process has unobserved heterogeneity that contributes additional randomness. This leads to mixture models, the negative binomial being only one example. A second reason is the failure of the Poisson process assumption and its replacement by a more general stochastic process.Some common departures from the standard Poisson regression are as follows.Failure of the mean-equals-variance restriction: Frequently the conditional variance of data exceeds the conditional mean, which is usually referred to as extra-Poisson variation or overdispersion relative to the Poisson model. Overdispersion may result from neglected or unobserved heterogeneity that is inadequately captured by the covariates in the conditional mean function. It is common to allow for random variation in the Poisson conditional mean by introducing a multiplicative error term. This leads to families of mixed Poisson models.[…]},

	title = {Statistical methods for {NHS} incident reporting data},
	abstract = {The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) is the English and Welsh NHS' national repository of incident reports from healthcare. It aims to capture details of incident reports, at national level, and facilitate clinical review and learning to improve patient safety. These incident reports range from minor `near-misses' to critical incidents that may lead to severe harm or death. NRLS data are currently reported as crude counts and proportions, but their major use is clinical review of the free-text descriptions of incidents. There are few well-developed quantitative analysis approaches for NRLS, and this thesis investigates these methods. A literature review revealed a wealth of clinical detail, but also systematic constraints of NRLS' structure, including non-mandatory reporting, missing data and misclassification. Summary statistics for reports from 2010/11 – 2016/17 supported this and suggest NRLS was not suitable for statistical modelling in isolation. Modelling methods were advanced by creating a hybrid dataset using other sources of hospital casemix data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). A theoretical model was established, based on `exposure' variables (using casemix proxies), and `culture' as a random-effect. The initial modelling approach examined Poisson regression, mixture and multilevel models. Overdispersion was significant, generated mainly by clustering and aggregation in the hybrid dataset, but models were chosen to reflect these structures. Further modelling approaches were examined, using Generalized Additive Models to smooth predictor variables, regression tree-based models including Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks. Models were also extended to examine a subset of death and severe harm incidents, exploring how sparse counts affect models. Text mining techniques were examined for analysis of incident descriptions and showed how term frequency might be used. Terms were used to generate latent topics models used, in-turn, to predict the harm level of incidents. Model outputs were used to create a `Standardised Incident Reporting Ratio' (SIRR) and cast this in the mould of current regulatory frameworks, using process control techniques such as funnel plots and cusum charts. A prototype online reporting tool was developed to allow NHS organisations to examine their SIRRs, provide supporting analyses, and link data points back to individual incident reports.},

The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor \&\#x3b7; = \&\#x3a3; \&\#x3b2;$_{\textrm{jXj}}$ is replaced by the additive predictor \&\#x3a3; s$_{\textrm{j}}$(X$_{\textrm{j}}$); hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

	doi = {10/fn6m6v},
	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

The recognition that human error is inevitable in a highly complex and technical field like medicine is a first step in promoting greater awareness of the importance of systems failure in the causation of accidents. Plane crashes are not usually caused by pilot error per se but by an amalgam of technical, environmental, organisational, social and communication factors which predispose to human error or worsen its consequences. In healthcare, the systematic investigation of error in the administration of medication will often reveal similarly complex causation. Experience and research from other sectors, in particular the airline industry, show that the impact of human error can be reduced if the necessary work is put in to detect and then remove weaknesses and vulnerabilties in the system. The NHS is putting in place a comprehensive programme to learn more effectively from adverse events and near misses. This aims to reduce the burden of the estimated 850,000 adverse events which occur in hospitals each year as well as targeting high risk areas such as medication error.},

	title = {To {Err} is {Human}: {Building} a {Safer} {Health} {System}},
	abstract = {Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS–three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors than from workplace injuries. Add the financial cost to the human tragedy, and medical error easily rises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread public problems. To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequence–but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agenda–with state and local implications–for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system. This volume reveals the often startling statistics of medical error and the disparity between the incidence of error and public perception of it, given many patients' expectations that the medical profession always performs perfectly. A careful examination is made of how the surrounding forces of legislation, regulation, and market activity influence the quality of care provided by health care organizations and then looks at their handling of medical mistakes. Using a detailed case study, the book reviews the current understanding of why these mistakes happen. A key theme is that legitimate liability concerns discourage reporting of errors–which begs the question, "How can we learn from our mistakes?" Balancing regulatory versus market-based initiatives and public versus private efforts, the Institute of Medicine presents wide-ranging recommendations for improving patient safety, in the areas of leadership, improved data collection and analysis, and development of effective systems at the level of direct patient care. To Err Is Human asserts that the problem is not bad people in health care–it is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Comprehensive and straightforward, this book offers a clear prescription for raising the level of patient safety in American health care. It also explains how patients themselves can influence the quality of care that they receive once they check into the hospital. This book will be vitally important to federal, state, and local health policy makers and regulators, health professional licensing officials, hospital administrators, medical educators and students, health caregivers, health journalists, patient advocates–as well as patients themselves.

Design: Weighted linear regression analysis of routinely collected data over four years, with hospital standardised mortality ratios as the dependent variable. Setting: England. Subjects:Eight million discharges from NHS hospitals when the primary diagnosis was one of the diagnoses accounting for 80\% of inpatient deaths. Main outcome measures: Hospital standardised mortality ratios and predictors of variations in these ratios. Results: The four year crude death rates varied across hospitals from 3.4\% to 13.6\% (average for England 8.5\%), and standardised hospital mortality ratios ranged from 53 to 137 (average for England 100). The percentage of cases that were emergency admissions (60\% of total hospital admissions) was the best predictor of this variation in mortality, with the ratio of hospital doctors to beds and general practitioners to head of population the next best predictors. When analyses were restricted to emergency admissions (which covered 93\% of all patient deaths analysed) number of doctors per bed was the best predictor. Conclusion: Analysis of hospital episode statistics reveals wide variation in standardised hospital mortality ratios in England. The percentage of total admissions classified as emergencies is the most powerful predictor of variation in mortality. The ratios of doctors to head of population served, both in hospital and in general practice, seem to be critical determinants of standardised hospital death rates; the higher these ratios, the lower the death rates in both cases.\%U http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/318/7197/1515.full.pdf},

The percentage of people admitted who died in hospital or within 30 days of discharge was 4.2\% for males and 4.5\% for females. Emergency admissions comprised 75\% of all admissions and 5.5\% died, in contrast to 0.8\% who died after an elective admission. The percentage who died with a Charlson comorbidity score of 0 was 2\% in contrast with 15\% who died with a score greater than 5. Given these variables, the relative standardised mortality rates of the hospitals were not noticeably changed by adjusting for the area level deprivation and number of previous emergency visits to hospital. There was little evidence that including interaction terms changed the relative values by any great amount. Using these predictors the summary hospital mortality index (SHMI) was derived. For 2007/8 the model had a C statistic of 0.911 and accounted for 81\% of the variability of between hospital mortality. A random effects funnel plot was used to identify outlying hospitals. The outliers from the SHMI over the period 2005-10 have previously been identified using other mortality indicators. Conclusion The SHMI is a relatively simple tool that can be used in conjunction with other information to identify hospitals that may need further investigation.},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine the proportion of avoidable deaths (due to acts of omission and commission) in acute hospital trusts in England and to determine the association with the trust's hospital-wide standardised mortality ratio assessed using the two commonly used methods - the hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR) and the summary hospital level mortality indicator (SHMI).Design Retrospective case record review of deaths.Setting 34 English acute hospital trusts (10 in 2009 and 24 in 2012/13) randomly selected from across the spectrum of HSMR.Main outcome measures Avoidable death, defined as those with at least a 50\% probability of avoidability in view of trained medical reviewers. Association of avoidable death proportion with the HSMR and the SHMI assessed using regression coefficients, to estimate the increase in avoidable death proportion for a one standard deviation increase in standardised mortality ratio.Participants 100 randomly selected hospital deaths from each trust.Results The proportion of avoidable deaths was 3.6\% (95\% confidence interval 3.0\% to 4.3\%). It was lower in 2012/13 (3.0\%, 2.4\% to 3.7\%) than in 2009 (5.2\%, 3.8\% to 6.6\%). This difference is subject to several factors, including reviewers' greater awareness in 2012/13 of orders not to resuscitate, patients being perceived as sicker on admission, minor differences in review form questions, and cultural changes that might have discouraged reviewers from criticising other clinicians. There was a small but statistically non-significant association between HSMR and the proportion of avoidable deaths (regression coefficient 0.3, 95\% confidence interval -0.2 to 0.7). The regression coefficient was similar for both time periods (0.1 and 0.3). This implies that a difference in HSMR of between 105 and 115 would be associated with an increase of only 0.3\% (95\% confidence interval -0.2\% to 0.7\%) in the proportion of avoidable deaths. A similar weak non-significant association was observed for SHMI (regression coefficient 0.3, 95\% confidence interval -0.3 to 1.0).Conclusions The small proportion of deaths judged to be avoidable means that any metric based on mortality is unlikely to reflect the quality of a hospital. The lack of association between the proportion of avoidable deaths and hospital-wide SMRs partly reflects methodological shortcomings in both metrics. Instead, reviews of individual deaths should focus on identifying ways of improving the quality of care, whereas the use of standardised mortality ratios should be restricted to assessing the quality of care for conditions with high case fatality for which good quality clinical data exist.},

  abstract = {PROBLEM: There are wide variations in hospital mortality. Much of this variation remains unexplained and may reflect quality of care. SETTING: A large acute hospital in an urban district in the North of England. DESIGN: Before and after evaluation of a hospital mortality reduction programme. STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Audit of hospital deaths to inform an evidence-based approach to identify processes of care to target for the hospital strategy. Establishment of a hospital mortality reduction group with senior leadership and support to ensure the alignment of the hospital departments to achieve a common goal. Robust measurement and regular feedback of hospital deaths using statistical process control charts and summaries of death certificates and routine hospital data. Whole system working across a health community to provide appropriate end of life care. Training and awareness in processes of high quality care such as clinical observation, medication safety and infection control. EFFECTS: Hospital standardized mortality ratios fell significantly in the 3 years following the start of the programme from 94.6 (95\% confidence interval 89.4, 99.9) in 2001 to 77.5 (95\% CI 73.1, 82.1) in 2005. This translates as 905 fewer hospital deaths than expected during the period 2002-2005. LESSONS LEARNT: Improving the safety of hospital care and reducing hospital deaths provides a clear and well supported goal from clinicians, managers and patients. Good leadership, good information, a quality improvement strategy based on good local evidence and a community-wide approach may be effective in improving the quality of processes of care sufficiently to reduce hospital mortality.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Risk adjustment is essential before comparing patient outcomes across hospitals. Hospital report cards around the country use different risk adjustment methods. OBJECTIVES: To examine the history and current practices of risk adjusting hospital death rates and consider the implications for using risk-adjusted mortality comparisons to assess quality. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: This article examines severity measures used in states and regions to produce comparisons of risk-adjusted hospital death rates. Detailed results are presented from a study comparing current commercial severity measures using a single database. It included adults admitted for acute myocardial infarction (n=11880), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (n=7765), pneumonia (n=18016), and stroke (n=9407). Logistic regressions within each condition predicted in-hospital death using severity scores. Odds ratios for in-hospital death were compared across pairs of severity measures. For each hospital, z scores compared actual and expected death rates. RESULTS: The severity measure called Disease Staging had the highest c statistic (which measures how well a severity measure discriminates between patients who lived and those who died) for acute myocardial infarction, 0.86; the measure called All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups had the highest for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 0.83; and the measure, MedisGroups, had the highest for pneumonia, 0.85 and stroke, 0.87. Different severity measures predicted different probabilities of death for many patients. Severity measures frequently disagreed about which hospitals had particularly low or high z scores. Agreement in identifying low- and high-mortality hospitals between severity-adjusted and unadjusted death rates was often better than agreement between severity measures. CONCLUSIONS: Severity does not explain differences in death rates across hospitals. Different severity measures frequently produce different impressions about relative hospital performance. Severity-adjusted mortality rates alone are unlikely to isolate quality differences across hospitals.},

  abstract = {The history of monitoring the outcomes of health care by external agencies can be traced to ancient times. However, the danger, now as then, is that in the search for improvement, comparative measures of mortality and morbidity are often overinterpreted, resulting in judgments about the underlying quality of care. Such judgments can translate into performance management strategies in the form of capricious sanctions (such as star ratings) and unjustified rewards (such as special freedoms or financial allocations). The resulting risk of stigmatising an entire institution injects huge tensions into health-care organisations and can divert attention from genuine improvement towards superficial improvement or even gaming behaviour (ie, manipulating the system). These dangers apply particularly to measures of outcome and throughput. We argue that comparative outcome data (league tables) should not be used by external agents to make judgments about quality of hospital care. Although they might provide a reasonable measure of quality in some high-risk surgical situations, they have little validity in acute medical settings. Their use to support a system of reward and punishment is unfair and, unsurprisingly, often resisted by clinicians and managers. We argue further that although outcome data are useful for research and monitoring trends within an organisation, those who wish to improve care for patients and not penalise doctors and managers, should concentrate on direct measurement of adherence to clinical and managerial standards.},

Given the importance of all these activities, the measures used to assess quality must have sufficient validity and reliability. This is not true of the main measure being used in many countries, including the United Kingdom, the hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR).1 Before considering practical and methodological shortcomings in England, many of which are considered by Lilford and Pronovost in the linked article (doi:10.1136/bmj.c2016),2 the concept of using hospital deaths to judge the performance of a hospital needs to be considered.A consequence of a failure to provide alternative forms of care has been that hospitals have taken on the role of providing a place for people to die. About half of us will end our days in a hospital bed. This makes it perverse to use a hospital's mortality statistics to judge its quality of care, given that deaths are often an expected and accepted outcome. The incongruity of using mortality to assess a hospital is exacerbated by geographical variation in the proportion of deaths that occur in hospital (40-65\%), which reflect not only the availability of alternative forms of end of life care, such as hospices and \ldots}

Some hospitals take care of sicker patients than other hospitals. Some surgeons operate on patients whom other surgeons feel exceed their skill levels. We do not want to penalise hospitals or doctors who accept referrals for more complex patients. Yet, we also do not want to miss opportunities for improvement. Maybe a particular hospital that cares for sicker patients achieves worse outcomes than other hospitals with similar patient populations.This debate over the adequacy of case-mix adjustment dates back to Florence Nightingale's publication of league tables for mortality in 19th century English hospitals.1 We have made some progress. Some successes have involved supplementing the diagnostic codes and demographic information available in administrative data with a few key clinical variables.2 ,3 Particularly notable successes consist entirely of clinical variables collected for the sole purpose of predicting risk, such as the various prognostic scoring systems for critically ill patients, such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score4\textendash 6 and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.7 (Occasionally, research shows that an outcome measure does not require adjustment for case-mix.8)But, what if comparing mortality rates (or other key patient outcomes) were problematic even with perfect case-mix adjustment?

Open data will make health providers honest and patients better able to choose between them. How simple is that?Rather too simple, to judge by evidence presented to the public inquiry into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which has shown that the old NHS had ingenious ways of burnishing its outcomes and concealing its failings. Even death, the most unambiguous outcome of all, lost its sting when changes in coding practice resulted in many deaths being excluded from the calculation of hospital mortality ratios.Whether this amounted to actual dishonesty may never be determined. In his final submission Tom Kark, counsel to the inquiry, suggested that it may not be necessary for Robert Francis, the inquiry's chair, to make any finding of fact over claims that Mid-Staffs and two other West Midlands trusts engaged in a plan to lower their apparent mortality ratios by changing the way patients were coded.1 Nor did Kark reach any firm conclusion over the suggestion that West Midlands Strategic Health Authority (SHA) sought to muddy the waters by commissioning a critical report into mortality measures, published in the BMJ, from academics known to disbelieve in the method.Both these charges were made in evidence to the inquiry by Professor Brian Jarman, the father of the hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR, see box), which has been used for the past decade by the health analytics company Dr Foster to compare hospital performance.
